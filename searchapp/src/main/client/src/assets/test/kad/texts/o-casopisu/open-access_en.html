<h1><strong>Open Access</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2017, the journal is also available in the Open Access database, with the printed and electronic versions being the same.</p>
<p>Open access to scientific information is defined as &lsquo;permanent and free online access to documents (in particular full texts) for all users. This status includes free and unlimited reading, downloading, copying, sharing, saving, printing and hypertext linking.&rsquo; Nevertheless, Open Access as a movement is almost exclusively focused on the publication of scientific peer-reviewed articles or scientific books.</p>
<p>The Czech Academy of Sciences signed the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://openaccess.mpg.de/Berlin-Declaration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities</a></strong> in the spring of 2008 as the first institution from the Czech Republic. In September&nbsp;2010, the Academic Council of the CAS approved the <a href="http://www.avcr.cz/opencms/export/sites/avcr.cz/.content/galerie-souboru/Politika_otevreneho_pristupu_v_AVCR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Open-Access Policy at the CAS</strong></a>. In 2016, the CAS also signed the <a href="https://oa2020.org/mission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Expression of Interest</strong></a> of the <a href="https://oa2020.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>OA2020</strong></a> initiative.
