<h1><strong>Instructions for authors</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Review procedure:</strong></p>
<p>The editorial board accepts articles corresponding to the focus of the journal or it may request an article from an author. The articles are accepted throughout the calendar year, with the deadline for the current issue being 31 May. An article to be included in the peer-reviewed section (Studies) is first &nbsp;assessed by the editor-in-chief in cooperation with the editorial board. At this stage, the article may be returned to the author to be complemented or reworked, or it can be entirely rejected for serious formal or content deficiencies.</p>
<p>If the article is accepted by the editorial board, it undergoes a standard review process. Every article is reviewed by two experts, who prepare independent reviews. The text author&rsquo;s name is removed before the text is sent to the reviewers. The reviewers are selected by the editorial board while taking into account the specialisation of the text. In exceptional and justifiable cases, a reviewer may be a member of the editorial board, but preference is given to reviewers from outside. If the author of the submitted article is a member of the editorial board, the other reviewer must always come from outside the editorial board.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the reviews are contradictory, the editorial board is guided by the stricter review or it requests a third, external review. The author receives all the reviews along with a statement as to whether the article must be reworked or complemented. In justified cases, when the article must be essentially reworked, the text may not be published in the forthcoming issue of the journal.</p>
<p>Project Reports, Discussions and Varia sections contain articles that do not go through the standard review process.</p>
<p>The relation between the author and the publisher is governed by the Agreement on the Creation of a Copyrighted Work and Licensing Agreement.</p>
