<h1><strong>Publication ethics</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The editorial board requires the authors of the articles to adhere to the basic ethical principles related to publication while observing these rules in its own editorial work. The editorial board accepts only original texts based on scientific research that have not been published in printed or electronic form. The texts must not be published elsewhere during an ongoing review process either. The editors reject non-original texts without a review procedure, but they may also reject texts sent by the author for review to multiple journals.</p>
<p>The authors must carry out their work in compliance with the basic international ethical standards, mainly the <strong><a href="https://www.elsevier.com/editors/perk">Elsevier Publishing Ethics Resource Kit /PERK/</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://publicationethics.org/resources/code-conduct">COPE&rsquo;s Code of Conduct</a></strong>, specifically with the aim to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>publish articles in the spirit of critical research in order to expand current scientific knowledge;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>publish true and authentic data and research outcomes processed at the highest professional level;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adhere to the principles of scientific publishing including explicit references to the relevant published literature as well as archival and other sources and to adhere properly to the citation system and standards specified by the editorial board;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>avoid plagiarism, self-plagiarism, text recycling and other undesirable practices.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
